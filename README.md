# Cataract Classification
## About
Multi-class Cataract Classification using ML techniques on Eye images

## Model
We have applied VGG19 Convolutional Neural Network model which is 19 layers deep. It applies transfer learning as it uses the pre-trained weights from images in ImageNet.

## Classes
The model is able to classify a given image of the eye into the following classes:
- Normal
- Cataract
- Diabetes
- Glaucoma
- Hypertension
- Myopia
- Age Issues
- Other
